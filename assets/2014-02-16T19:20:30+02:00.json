  "content": "<div><div>The growth of the indie scene, and the importance of indie games, has been one of the defining facets of the games industry over the last ten years. The explosion of digital distribution, a raft of new platforms (hello Steam, hello App Store!) and a lowering of the general barrier to entry for making games have all been factors, and it’s made for some exciting – and entirely novel – gaming experiences.</div><div>When I think about my favourite indie games, however, very few of them are Japanese. I think about games like Braid, The Stanley Parable, Journey, Fez, Rogue Legacy and Papers, Please… and they’re just the tip of an absolutely enormous iceberg. When I think about Japanese indies, on the other hand, far fewer games come to mind.</div></div>",
