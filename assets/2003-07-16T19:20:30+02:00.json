  "content": "<div><div>Another week, another batch of Westworld fan theories. Last week's episode definitely asked more questions than it answered (so the Man in Black is a good guy in the outside world?), and our intrigue is amped up to 11. Here's what the internet is saying this week.</div><div>Ok, this isn’t so much of a theory as a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it fact. It’s not immediately clear, but watch the fourth episode a couple of times and you’ll see that the hosts who were a big part of Lee’s rejected ‘Odyssey on Red River’ storyline are now essentially slaves working on expanding the park for Ford’s new storyline.</div></div>",
