  "title": "A RESPONSE TO BETHESDA'S REVIEW COPIES POLICY",
  "content": "<div><div>On Tuesday, Bethesda Softworks – publisher of popular game series The Elder Scrolls and Fallout, as well as renowned games like Wolfenstein, Doom, and Dishonored – announced it would no longer provide reviewers access to its unreleased games until 24 hours before launch. It’s a policy that upends decades of gamers being able to rely on impartial critics to provide them an idea of a game’s quality when it goes on sale. We think this policy is damaging – for informed gamers, for games criticism in general, and even for Bethesda.</div><div>Obviously, Bethesda’s games are its property to do with as it pleases, and there is certainly nothing requiring them to be submitted for review. However, there is a reason providing early access to critics has been the standard practice in the games industry (as well as film, books, etc) since the very beginning: It’s a show of good faith. Allowing independent critics to evaluate a product and recommend it accordingly is a courtesy to consumers, and a demonstration that publishers and developers have confidence in the thing they’re asking you to spend money on and in the review process.</div></div>",
